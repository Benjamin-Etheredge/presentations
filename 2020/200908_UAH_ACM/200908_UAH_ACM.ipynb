    "* Brainstorming - new uses for existing solutions\n",
    "* Hands on Code - for those times when you just have to run something for yourself\n",
    "* Coworking Night - maybe have combined sessions with other groups to discuss application in their focus areas\n",
    "* Community - get to know others in the field. Provide talks like this one and support local tech events (HATCH, SpaceApps)"
