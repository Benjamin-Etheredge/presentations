# Integrating AI and AR

## Moving AI to mobile devices

Before AI models were available to be run on mobile devices, most applications followed something along these lines:

1. Grab data on the device
2. Move it to a storage location
3. Trigger some operation (possibly store the results as well)
4. Respond to the device with the results

To be "believable", we need better performance to combine with reality.
