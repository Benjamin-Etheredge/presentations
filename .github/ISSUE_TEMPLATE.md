# Adding material to the presentations repository

Add the file to present (prefer Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown formated files) to the folder structure. For multiple files, create a directory following the naming convention and add the files to it.

## Naming convention

We use a convention of starting the filenames with a date (year/month/day) so that the files are still sorted by date even when in alphabetical format.
